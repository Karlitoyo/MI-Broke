 # Executive Summary
 
In the current Covid-19 global crisis, there is a substantial amount of businesses that will suffer financially, not only to develop and grow, but even to meet their most basic 
needs for keeping afloat. In the case of SMEs, a part of them will not even have the expertise and resources needed to make an estimation on how much time they have left in the 
market, and guidance on how they can resolve their financial shortcomings.
On the other hand, we are witnessing a very wide range of organizations and influencer bodies willing to lend a hand, whether it is through funding, loans, or counselling for 
businesses that are struggling across the EU.
We have created a platform that helps support SMEs in that regard, helping them run a financial analysis of their business and judge their state in a matter of seconds. To solve 
the shortcomings identified, we also provide a wide knowledge base of resources that can help these businesses not only keep afloat, but also start growing and gaining their footing 
very quickly.

  > # Products and Services

The main service we are looking to offer is a simple, quick and free calculator, which business owners/employees can use to 
get an idea on where their business stands financially, as well as how much time is left in case they are going towards bankruptcy. 
It will be free for everyone, and will not require any personal data.

As well, the business owners are going to be served with a knowledge base of opportunities and some suggestions on next steps they can 
take to improve their financials, such as grants from the government or other private financial institutions, vouchers that other providers 
are offering for free to SMEs to get them back on track, etc. This feature will be free and very useful for the business owners. Additionally 
it will function as an affiliate program between M I Broke and the partners that are going to be promoted there. For every lead that we are going 
to send to their acquisition funnels, we get a small fee in return. As well, depending on the partner (mainly non-government), we can charge a small 
partnership fee.

A third main feature is offering business owners exclusive access to discounts and vouchers, offered by partners for users gaining access to their funnels 
from our website. (in progress)


## Scaling-Opportunities

Create log-in opportunity for users which will enable new features such as financial expertise & counselling, community meetups, webinars and tutorials, offered 
to premium users for a small subscription fee.

For a better analysis of financial status, business owners could connect their accounts via Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) API’s. This will also provide a better 
onboarding experience and could offer proof statements in future when SME owners will apply for grants. We plan to use the API’s as License-as-a-Service from an already 
registered account information service provider (AISP).


## Market-Opportunities

There were approximately 25.1 million small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in the European Union in FY2018/2019, where the vast majority of them only employ 9 or less 
employees. Approximately 1.5 million is composed of businesses with 10-249 employees.
Having said that, in different markets, the contribution of SMEs to each country’s economy is different, so in every market, the value and support that will be awarded in 
total will be in accordance with that fact. EU-wide, the average value that SMEs contribute to the economy is around 56%, and they employ around 100 million people.


## Competitive-Advantage

Even though the current Covid-19 situation has dampened the outlook considerably, numbers for FY2019 show that SMEs are an important aspect of the economy, and should be protected 
in particular.We see from a market overview and Competitor analysis, that even if SMEs are being addressed, the main goal of our competitors is to help them get acquired by bigger 
companies, which in the current situation is not realistic for every microbusiness. This happens for a multitude of reasons, one of them being because businesses do not have the 
potential to be acquired, and because business owners might not be interested to sell, but instead get their business back on its feet, as their main source of income.
We see a space in the market, to provide SMEs with a knowledge base of valuable information on where to get necessary funding in the form of grants, loans or discounts to turn the 
tables and start growing steadily. We see M I Broke serving as an online financial consultant for these small businesses that might not have the resources for a traditional financial 
consultant, like the bigger companies have the luxury to hire.



## Competitor-analysis

---Primary Competitors---

KMUrechner (https://kmurechner.de/was-kann-der-kmurechner/) -- Offers a similar financial status calculator. The company is focused on the same target users as M I Broke, however, 
its focal point is not actually helping the businesses recover, but helping them get an idea of how much the business owners can profit for selling their business, or being acquired 
by bigger companies.

StarkPartners (https://starkpartners.de/was-ist-mein-unternehmen-wert/) Also operating in Germany only, and with a strong focus on helping companies get acquired.

---Secondary Competitors---

MyValutico (https://my.valutico.com) offers a much more complicated calculator, for which the user has to have financial knowledge to actually get a reliable result. It is based in 
big data forecasting, and its target audience are mainly investors and consultants. Its main revenue stream is making money by pairing companies with consultants or possible investors. 

Nimbo (https://www.nimbo.de) offers also valuation of the businesses, interested in linking entrepreneurs with consulting for selling or improving companies.


## Opportunities

Our primary and secondary competitors mainly do calculations that are much more time consuming and require that the business owner has some financial knowledge in order to provide 
reliable results, not taking into account the impact of guessing or incorrect information when completing the questionnaire. In that regard, it is an opportunity for us to tap into 
the potential of smaller companies with very little expertise having a real chance to know their value.

In general, our competitors’ aim for the businesses is helping them get an understanding of their own value with the purpose of selling their businesses or getting them acquired by 
bigger companies, which in the current situation is out of context for many SMEs, since the Corona crisis has made it even tougher for mergers & acquisitions. As well, there are a 
lot of businesses that are not looking to be sold or do not have the potential for it. Their best chance would be to try to overcome this crisis, by receiving knowledge and access 
to funding and other opportunities.

In addition, our competitors are not offering a wide knowledge base of opportunities and tools to help businesses overcome the crisis, which is exactly what we aim to address, 
complete with exclusive discounts and vouchers.


## Risks

A part of the competitors are already offering consulting services, and it is fairly feasible for them to use their consulting resources for another aim: that of overcoming the 
challenges of the current crisis. However, since they are not already doing it, we believe that they are comfortable in their niche.


 > # Sales-and-Marketing

 ## Profile

Nature of business: FinTech, financial analysis
Goal: Acquire new SMEs by delivering valuable resources and ideas for keeping business afloat and thriving in the current pandemic
Main client profile: SME owners/employees
Pain points: Don’t have enough info on financial funding options and resources.


## Marketing-Strategy

The marketing and sales strategy will be focused and fully supported by digital multi-channels. We will follow the customer journey fully on mobile in all the lifecycle stages:

Start/Intro stage 
Set up web and analytics tracking through the selected MarTech stack (Google Marketing Stack, Adobe Marketing Cloud, etc.)

Awareness stage
It will be achieved through 2 main touchpoints – Search and Ads. Prospects will search on Google, where they’ll see results for our solution (Content Marketing & Search Engine 
Optimization). Prospects will see display ads for our solution when navigating through websites, enticing them to try out the “Financial Analysis Calculator” and input email

Evaluation stage
It will be achieved through 3 main touchpoints – Website, Email & Social Media Marketing (Content Marketing, Email Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Digital Advertising). 
Prospects will receive a link where they can immediately calculate their situation. As well, they will be prompted for more info on how SMEs can solve the identified issues. 
While still in the consideration stage, they will see an invitation for online events/webinars to get more info on how to keep your business afloat, and get prompted to register 
for the event.

Purchase stage
It will be achieved through touchpoints SMS/Email and Website. The prospect will get a reminder either in SMS or email for the event/webinar they registered. During the event, 
the prospect is prompted to download and use the app, showing how to use a prominent feature and its benefits. When searching for financing options, he will be prompted with 
ads/search results with successful case studies and is convinced to register and use it fully. (Content Marketing, Mobile Marketing, Conversion Rate Optimization, Search Engine 
Optimization)

Retention Stage
Based on historical behavioural and purchase data, the user will be prompted with relevant content. As a result, the user re-engages with other products/services we offer as well 
as a well thought out loyalty scheme. (Marketing Automation, Content Marketing, Digital Marketing Analytics)


## Financial-Analysis

Revenue Streams
We have 2 potential revenue streams, the first one focuses on acquiring partnerships success fees for providing funding opportunities such as grants from the government or other
private financial institutions. The second revenue stream targets SMEs business owners which will go for a paid subscription in our platform for access to refined estimation with 
more detailed inputs and to benefit from vouchers and discounts for their business.

Revenue stream 1 = Partnerships success fee for grants and funding 

Revenue stream 2 = logged in users paying subscriptions for access to refined estimation with more detailed inputs, vouchers, discounts, etc.
